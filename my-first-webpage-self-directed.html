      <br>The first step therefore is to make the black man come to himself;
      <br>to pump life back into his empty shell;
      <br>to infuse him with pride and dignity,
      <br>to remind him of his complicity in the crime of allowing himself to be
      <br>misused and therefore letting evil reign supreme in the country of his birth.
      <br>

      <br>This is the definition of “Black Consciousness.”
